# Privacy policy

## Introduction

This privacy policy outlines how Doclin manages and protects any information you provide when using our Vscode extension.

## Data We Collect

We collect your email and GitHub username upon registration. We DO NOT require access to your git repository, nor do we collect any sensitive information about it. When you add a code comment, we only store the:

1. Selected code snippet,
2. File path, and
3. Branch name.

We do not store any reference to the git repository or collect demographic information about users.

## Use of Data

We use user data to enable real-time commenting and provide notifications on app activity. We store the code snippet, file path, and branch name to display relevant threads based on the user's current workspace.

## Data Retention

We retain user data for as long as necessary to provide the service, and for legal or regulatory purposes. You have the right to delete all data, including comments, user, and organization information from our systems.

## How We Store Your Data

We securely store your data on our cloud. All comment data are encrypted at rest.

## Access to Your Data

Only members of your organization can access your data. Doclin developers cannot access user data unless a user explicitly adds a developer to the organization.

## Data Sharing

To send you notifications, we provide your email address to our email service provider. We do not share your data with any other third parties.

## Changes to our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website or application. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.

## Your Consent

By using Doclin, you consent to our privacy policy.

Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy policy or the information we hold about you.
